# Final Project Overview

## My Final Data Story
### [A Garbage Deal](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/garbagedeal-seancuff/index.html)

## Project Description
For the last three years, the Friends of Lackawanna (FOL), a non-profit based out of Dunmore in Northeastern Pennsylvania, have been fighting an unprecedented expansion of the Keystone Sanitary Landfill (KSL). Up against a 40-year expansion plan, nearly 100 million more tons of most out of state trash, and business as usual politics, FOL has articulately defended their position in Borough Council meetings and in court, all while invigorating a public movement that is ushering transparency and public outrage against the status quo.

As an organization comprised of volunteers and small donations, they often lack the technical capabilities to connect their devasting facts to their neighbors’ stories. I hope this project can help bridge that divide and help push their campaign forward in the midst of shocking vote by the Borough Council.

## Project Structure
### Present the Story
FOL has done an extraordinary job presenting their case and their stories. I hope to highlight the work that has been and continues to be done and offering my visualizations as supplements to their work. As with anything in local politics, controversies like the ones surrounding KSL require high context. I hope to use the first section of my project to provide that context in a way that is informative and manageable for those outsiders looking in, be them environmentalists, public policy students, or state officials.

### KSL as It Is, and How it Got There
To contextualize and provide data analysis, I hope to use this section to detail the growth of KSL over the years, the origins of the trash coming to the community, and what comprises that trash. The biggest assertion by the KSL team has been that this deal will be good for the community. By exploring the data, we can begin to test that hypothesis and lay out the findings clearly and concisely. 

### Expansion in Context: What Dunmore, Lackawanna County, and NEPA Have to Lose
One of the most ominous aspects of the KSL expansion is in its topography. As a site, it has come to dominate the skyline since I was a kid. If the expansion were to be approved, it would be allowed to grow above the mountains surrounding Dunmore’s valley community. Presenting the data in a way that accurately reflects that and is compelling will be critical to the project. 

### Solutions
There is no grand, clear solution here other than stopping bad public policy. If the current conditions continue as they are, just without a massive landfill expansion, the roads will still be in rough shape, the air quality poor from what exists on site, the water polluted from inadequate containment processes of the past, job growth weak, population flowing out and aging, and the hill as it is still standing. 

The only solution is the counterfactual: what can this community become under those conditions without a landfill expansion being accepted. The answer to that is well beyond the scope of this project. It involves a greater depth of conversation, public activism, transparent politics, and innovative public policy solutions that had long gone unexplored and advocated until a community stood up against a powerful business selling a false choice. 

In this case, the solution is in the process and the fight. I hope this project could support that.

## Data
Primary Source: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) – [Solid Waste Disposal Data](http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/powerbiproxy/powerbi/Public/DEP/WM/PBI/Solid_Waste_Disposal_Information)

This data set includes annual data on the solid waste tonnage accepted by collection sites in Pennsylvania, including specific data by PA Counties and neighboring states. The set also includes data on the types of solid waste accepted by a facility, including asbestos, construction/demolition, and sewage sludge, among others.

## Method and Medium
In terms of methods, I plan to use the Tableau to help manage the amount of data and its configuration. As a means of presenting certain aspects of the data, I would like to find a way to transpose that data onto topographical forms. Based on my current thought process, this wouldn’t be in GIS as I would like to present that data comparatively (ex: heights of different buildings, adjacent mountaintops, etc.). To convey the timeline of events to provide context to the story, I would like to use an interactive feature to encourage views to interact with the details.

For user research, I will contact FOL’s leadership and members for feedback as I develop the story and data visualizations. Ultimately, a goal of this project is for it to be an actionable and compelling resource for their efforts.

The medium I hope to use is Shorthand. It looks to be a polished platform that would be easy for organizers to link to and share. Most of their communications are through social media, so a medium conducive to that will best serve the project.

## User Research Plan
### Background
This project is focused on providing data visualizations of solid waste tonnage accepted by the Keystone Sanitary Landfill (KSL) in Dunmore, PA. It is my hope that this project will better serve local community group, Friends of Lackawanna’s (FOL) campaign to prevent an unprecedented 40-year expansion of KSL.

To complete the user research, I will be speaking to two active members of FOL and one resident of Dunmore who is aware of their work, but not actively participating in their organization or campaign. I anticipate this process will improve my audience targeting to better connect with residents. In addition to improved messaging, I expect reviewing mock-up data visualizations both expand the scope of relevant data, and ensure the visualizations are presenting the data in a widely understandable way.

This will be a review of existing story boards, wireframes, and data sources.

### Metrics of Success
1.	Whether participants understand the message and goals of the project.
1.	Does the story and data, as presented, add value to the organization/debate occurring in the community?
1.	Whether the viewer is visually stimulated by the presentation of the data.

### Methods
* 10 minute interviews with FOL organizers and local residents
* Note taking
* Face-time or video chat as all participants are remote and physical reactions are valuable data

### Findings
1. User requested data be shared on the growth of residual waste coming into the community.
1. User felt the story lacked concision. For them, it seemed I was trying to tell the whole story, and in reality telling multiple, weaker stories in the process.
1. User noticed there was no clear call to action at the end of the story.
1. User suggested the timeline of events was outside of the scope of the story.

## Audience
The intended audience of my data story, “A Garbage Deal,” are individuals familiar and/or participating in the Friends of Lackawanna’s campaign against the Keystone Sanitary Landfill expansion. I determined this to be the best approach because of the high local context necessary to understand the issue from an outsider’s perspective. Though this would be an ideal final audience to reach, my extent of participation in the organization does not make me the best voice to do so.

Ideally, I hope this story will inform my target audience in a way that arms them with the facts. It is my hope that this medium could be expanded upon by FOL to better make their case and improve their campaign on their terms. Through the user research I have done so far, I will connect the campaign leadership with the tools I used to create my story.

## Design Decisions
There were a few specific design decisions I made that can provide a behind the scenes look into my process and intentions. 

* As a color scheme, I matched FOLs green because I wanted this to be a tool I could pass off to them.
* In the second visualization, I intentionally wanted the graphic to scroll horizontally. There is a lot of information displayed in a relatively small space, but I believe it highlights the number of counties and states contributing to the landfill.
* Inclusion of a scroll bar for annual data allows the viewer to do some exploring themselves and engage with the data.
* Aggregated data is generally the topline data users found most useful. Presenting that first seemed best.
* Inclusion of the FOL photo – _Mountain of Garbage_ – captured, in my opinion, much of the context an outside observer would need should they also be interested in this story.
* I found it challenging to include photos in my project for two reasons. First, the quality of photos of or about KSL was poor, most often from a smartphone or published in the Scranton Times-Tribune. Second, and I would argue most important, reason was that because many of the conversations seeking to discredit FOL's campaign are, generously, not on the level. Any local viewers with adverse opinions would quickly and happily discredit the story completely if I had included open source photos of a different landfill or locale.
