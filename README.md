# Sean Cuff's Public Portfolio

## About Me
I am a second year MSPPM student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College where I am focused on economic and community development. While at Heinz Iâ€™ve been able to serve as the President of the Politics & Policy Club, explore the consequences of tech change in the Mon Valley, and develop the skills I felt I was missing while working in the Massachusetts State Senate. I worked there for three years as a Fiscal Policy Analyst on the Ways & Means Committee where I worked on economic development, housing, homelessness, and transportation policies and finance. 

As a more personal biography, much of my psychology is driven by syndromes rooted in being the third of four children, the youngest of three boys, and the son born before my parents' only daughter. I've worked hard to channel these facts of life into skills in observation and learning from others' mistakes, a desire for personal independence, and a tight five on my older brothers' hairlines and idiosyncrasies. Born and raised in Scranton, PA, I'm an evangelist for the region's superior pizza style. Oh, and "Uncle Shhahn" is my nephew Jaxon's **FAVORITE** Uncle.

## What I hope to Learn in this Class
Effective data visualizations can be better than even the best argument. I saw this firsthand working in the Legislature, where our tightest writings of legislative language, back room talks, public talking points, and media pushes could fail to gain the traction necessary to make meaningful reform. Ultimately, the failure of passing those reforms didn't fail on our lack of strategy, or not effectively conveying the data highlighting the problem. The failure fell on the parents and children we were hoping to help, the same parents and children facing homeless and unnecessarily unsafe living conditions. 

Ultimately, I hope to make some meaningful change in some small way. I believe adding data visualization methods and skills can be another tool in trying to do so.
